# Turtlebot_Hallway_Guidance
Repository containing code for turtlebots to navigate the hallways of Halligan. 

Currently contains a srv files and servers to either look up the coordinates of one location by name OR to print out all locations. 

There is a patrol program where the robot patrols between two coordinates, and a door to door program where the robot moves from door to door for all the mapped locations on the second floor of the Halligan building.

This repository does not contain any packages so it cannot be run alone in a terminal. Purpose is just to store the files, the files must be copied into another package in order to run.
