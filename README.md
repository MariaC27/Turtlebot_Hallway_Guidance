# Turtlebot_Hallway_Guidance
Repository containing code for turtlebots to navigate the hallways of Halligan. Currently contains a srv file server to print out a list of all the mapped coordinates, as well as a test file for the robot to move door to door to all the mapped locations. This repository does not contain any packages so it cannot be run alone in a terminal. Purpose is just to store the files, the files must be copied into another package in order to run.
